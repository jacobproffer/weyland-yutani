          As the largest company on the planet, we have taken
          it upon ourselves to constantly explore, expand and
          discover what lies beyond our own heavens. Every day,
          our biologists, military scientists, chemical engineers,
          geologists, mechanics and pilots work across our solar
          system to advance human interests and life. From Peter
          Weylandâ€™s first commercially viable cybernetic android
          to the invention of the atmospheric processor, the
          Weyland-Yutani Corporation has continued to innovate
          and work towards the realization of a better world.
